# Ways of recovering data with Aurora

Amazon Aurora maintains two types of backup: automated (continuous) backups and snapshots.

1. Backtracking

   **Backtrack is not available for Aurora PostgreSQL.**

2. PITR(Point in time recovery)

   ```
   You can specify a backup retention period from 1â€“35 days when you create or modify a DB cluster. Aurora automated backups are stored in Amazon S3.
   ```

3. Snapshot

   ```
   Unlike automated backups, manual snapshots aren't subject to the backup retention period. Snapshots don't expire.
   ```
